Connect using OpenVPN

For Linux operating system in my case<br>


Download your OpenVPN configuration pack associated to your account 

![3!](https://github.com/Roberto-Bruna/TryHackMe---Offensive-Pentesting-Learning-Path/blob/main/0-OpenVpnParrotOS/images/3.PNG?raw=true)


Install the VPN client
```bash
sudo apt install openvpn
```

Check the version installed: 
```bash
apt-cache policy openvpn
```

Open a terminal and type:<br>

ifconfig (we have the eth0 and loopback interfaces) <br>

Start the VPN client with the configuration downloaded from TryHackMe: <br>
```bash
sudo openvpn /path/to/file.ovpn
```

![5!](https://github.com/Roberto-Bruna/TryHackMe---Offensive-Pentesting-Learning-Path/blob/main/0-OpenVpnParrotOS/images/5.PNG?raw=true)<br>

<br>
Open a new terminal and type:<br>
ifconfig<br>
Now we have the VPN interface called “tun0”<br><br>
<br>
On the TryHackMe dashboard we can download files to connect to other VPN servers, we should choose the closest one

And we also have network information when we refresh the web: Server status ok, Connected ok, Internal Virtual IP Address, which is the IP given to the VPN interface to connect to the TryHackMe machines
